# Earthquakes Mapper ðŸ—º
React App without backend persistence. Users can view earthquakes from around the world on a Google map and filter based on specific times and earthquake magnitude. Earthquake information is from the [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/). You can read about how I implemented the Google Map [here on my blog](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/using-the-google-maps-javascript-api-in-a-react-project-b3ed734375c6).

### Components
This was my first React App, so it is fairly simple. The components are `EarthquakesContainer`, which has all other components as children. The children are `EarthquakesForm` with siblings `EarthquakesList` (which I no longer use) and `EarthquakesMap` (which overtook made `EarthquakesList` obsolete). `EarthquakesMap` has one child, `EarthquakesItem` which is the information that is displayed when a user clicks on the earthquake icon on the map.

`EarthquakesContainer` makes use of the [`google-maps-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react) component. For the map I utilized a terrain Google Map, Markers, PopUps and a Heatmap layer. Google Maps API documentation [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

Each earthquake data point the map receives is plotted on the map based on its coordinates, weighted (for Heatmap) based on its magnitude, and given a title (for popup).

### Services
Services holds the `fetch` requests to the USGS API. There `fetchQuakes` (which returns all earthquakes for last 30 days) and `searchQuakes` (which returns all earthquakes that meet user-specified criteria) functions. The results of the fetch requests are stored in the `quakes` state in the `EarthquakesContainer`.
